## Abstract

ASTRA-sim2.0 extends the open-source ASTRA-sim infrastructure with enhanced capabilities to model state-of-the-art and emerging distributed training models and platforms. It addresses the complex software/hardware co-design stack necessary for large-scale model training.

**Key Contributions**:
- Enhanced modeling of hierarchical network topologies
- Support for disaggregated system architectures
- Improved scalability for large-model training simulation

## Core Ideas

ASTRA-sim2.0 extends the original framework to handle modern training paradigms including hierarchical networks and disaggregated memory/compute systems. This enables more accurate simulation of emerging training platforms needed for models with billions to trillions of parameters.
