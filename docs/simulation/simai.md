## Abstract

SimAI is an artificial intelligence platform for simulation that enables training AI models directly with simulation results and geometry input, predicting performance for new designs in a continuous 3D physical field. It reduces the overall design cycle by 10-100X.

**Key Contributions**:
- Physics-agnostic machine learning for simulation
- 10-100X speedup in design cycle with full-fidelity accuracy
- Geometry-based input enabling broader design exploration
- Covers all physics domains from fluid mechanics to electromagnetics

## Core Ideas

SimAI uses physics-agnostic machine learning techniques to learn data-driven representations of governing equations from previous simulations. Typically requiring 30-100 simulation results for training, it can predict performance for new designs with 2 days of training, enabling rapid design space exploration across automotive, aerospace, and telecommunications applications.
