## Abstract

Abstract. With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technologies such as ChatGPT, AI agents, and video generation,
contemporary mobile systems have begun integrating these AI capabilities on local devices to enhance privacy and reduce response latency.
To meet the computational demands of AI tasks, current mobile SoCs are equipped with diverse AI accelerators, including GPUs and Neural Processing Units (NPUs).
However, there has not been a comprehensive characterization of these heterogeneous processors,
and existing designs typically only leverage a single AI accelerator for LLM inference,
leading to suboptimal use of computational resources and memory bandwidth. In this paper, we first summarize key performance characteristics of heterogeneous processors, SoC memory bandwidth, etc.
Drawing on these observations, we propose different heterogeneous parallel mechanisms to fully exploit both GPU and NPU computational power and memory bandwidth.
We further design a fast synchronization mechanism between heterogeneous processors that leverages the unified memory architecture.
By employing these techniques, we present HeteroInfer, the fastest LLM inference engine in mobile devices which supports GPU-NPU heterogeneous execution.
Evaluation shows that HeteroInfer delivers a 1.34 × \times to 6.02 × \times end-to-end speedup over state-of-the-art GPU-only and NPU-only LLM engines,
while maintaining negligible interference with other applications.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Driven by the rapid evolution in large language models (LLMs),
technologies such as ChatGPT (38, 32, 3, 12), AI agents (15, 62, 52, 53),
and video generation (61, 54, 14, 65) have gained widespread adoption.
Concurrently, as users increasingly prioritize the privacy of their personal data,
there is a growing trend towards executing model inference on local devices like smartphones.
To enable the efficient calculation of large language models on these mobile platforms,
contemporary mobile System-on-Chip (SoC) manufacturers have integrated various AI accelerators, including GPUs and neural processing units (NPUs).
These accelerators (58, 57, 25, 36, 24, 16, 59, 10) enhance capabilities for vector and matrix computations, aligning with the computational demands of AI applications.
For example, Qualcomm’s SoCs incorporate Adreno GPUs (44) and Hexagon NPUs (45) to address the computing needs of edge AI applications.

Prior studies (23, 17, 18) have proposed inference engines to leverage the computation capabilities of heterogeneous processors.
However, these solutions are predominantly tailored for cloud infrastructures and discrete accelerators,
rendering them incompatible with mobile platforms.
Although some researches (55, 34, 56) have explored mobile inference engines,
they still fall short in fully exploiting the computational power of mobile heterogeneous SoCs.
The limitation stems from three main factors:

*First*, the pronounced performance disparity between mobile NPUs and GPUs.
For instance, on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 platform (41), the GPU achieves approximately 1 TFLOPS in practice (with a theoretical peak of 2.8 TFLOPS),
while the NPU delivers up to 10 TFLOPS (in actual) performance.
Thus, enforcing parallel execution of the GPU and NPU solely based on their raw computational power may not guarantee an improvement in end-to-end performance.
*Second*, synchronization overhead between heterogeneous processors is substantial.
On mobile platforms, GPU-NPU synchronization during LLM inference can take around 400 microseconds,
which is comparable to or even exceeds the execution time of individual GPU or NPU kernels.
*Third*, the decoding phase is inherently memory-intensive.
Merely offloading computation to GPU and NPU offers limited benefits and may even degrade performance due to additional synchronization overhead.
Consequently, designing a LLM inference engine that can efficiently coordinate all heterogeneous processors
in real-world mobile devices remains a substantial and unresolved challenge.

After an in-depth analysis of the heterogeneous processors within mobile SoCs,
we observe new opportunities to enhance LLM inference by
leveraging distinctive performance characteristics for heterogeneous processors.

- •
*Tensor-sensitive NPU performance.*
Although NPUs can achieve superior performance under ideal conditions,
their efficiency is highly dependent on tensor characteristics such as order, size, and shape.
If the characteristics of tensors involved in computation are not well-aligned with the NPU’s hardware architecture,
both utilization and performance may degrade significantly.
- •
*Unified memory architecture across processors.*
Unlike discrete accelerators, mobile CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs adopt a unified memory architecture (UMA) within the system memory,
featuring a shared address space that facilitates efficient inter-processor communication.
- •
*Memory bandwidth improved with multiple processors.*
A single processing unit is insufficient to fully saturate the SoC’s memory bandwidth.
For example, GPU alone can utilize only $40\sim 45$ GB/s of memory bandwidth in memory-intensive workloads.
In contrast, employing two processing units concurrently can achieve a memory bandwidth of about 60 GB/s (theoretical memory bandwidth in SoC is 68 GB/s).

In this paper, we introduce HeteroInfer, the fastest mobile inference engine, designed to efficiently leverage all heterogeneous processing units in mobile SoCs.
The CPU is employed as a control plane for synchronization and GPU kernel scheduling, as it is ill-suited for computing tasks due to the low energy efficiency.
The NPU serves as the primary computing unit, handling the majority of computing tasks,
while the GPU acts as a secondary computing unit to enhance the lower bound of NPU performance.
To efficiently leverage these heterogeneous computing resources,
HeteroInfer takes comprehensive account of the performance characteristics of the GPU and NPU,
such as stage performance, order-sensitive performance and shape-sensitive performance.

To enable both layer-level and tensor-level GPU-NPU parallelism on real-world mobile devices, HeteroInfer further introduces three techniques.
First, HeteroInfer applies different tensor partitioning strategies during both the prefill and decoding phases to facilitate tensor-level heterogeneous execution.
Second, HeteroInfer employs a fast synchronization mechanism based on predictable kernel waiting times to achieve microsecond-level synchronization.
Third, HeteroInfer incorporates a tensor partitioning solver that generates optimal partitioning solutions with the help of a hardware profiler.

We built an industrial-grade LLM inference engine on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC,
one of the most advanced mobile platforms that integrates Arm CPU, GPU and NPU.
To leverage both the GPU and NPU, we developed optimized GPU kernels using OpenCL
and integrated the NPU operators provided by Qualcomm’s QNN (43) into our framework.
We avoid using the activation quantization and sparsity techniques, as these techniques may decrease the accuracy of the model inference.

HeteroInfer is the first LLM engine to surpass 1000 tokens/sec in prefill phase and 50 tokens/sec in decoding phase, utilizing high-precision computation on mobile devices for billion-parameter scale LLMs.
In end-to-end evaluations, HeteroInfer achieves a speedup ranging from 1.34$\times$ to 6.02$\times$ compared to SOTA GPU-only and NPU-only frameworks across various ML workloads.
During the prefill phase, HeteroInfer accelerates the speed up to 3.69$\times$ over PI-2 (34) (NPU) and 8.68$\times$ compared to MNN (55) (GPU).
When the sequence length does not align with the NPU graph shape,
HeteroInfer delivers up to a 2.12$\times$ improvement over traditional padding-based methods.
In the decoding phase, HeteroInfer consistently outperforms existing frameworks,
achieving speedups between 1.50$\times$ and 2.53$\times$.
To evaluate performance interference, we run HeteroInfer concurrently with GPU-intensive workloads such as gaming.
HeteroInfer effectively minimizes interference between LLM and gaming tasks,
maintains stable frame rates (without FPS drop),
and incurs only a 2.2% slowdown in the prefill phase and 17.7% during decoding.

### 2.1. LLM Inference

Large Language Model (LLM) inference refers to the process of utilizing a pre-trained model to generate outputs based on user input.
It typically comprises two distinct phases: the prefill phase and the decoding phase.
In the prefill phase, the LLM processes the user’s input in a single batch to generate the first output token.
Given the potentially long input sequence, this phase relies on matrix multiplication operations, rendering it computationally intensive.
In contrast, decoding is a sequential and auto-regressive process, generating one token at a time.
It primarily involves matrix-vector multiplications, resulting in a memory-intensive workload.

In contrast to cloud-side LLM inference (e.g. vLLMs (26), orca (63), etc. (9, 28, 64, 69, 67, 48, 40, 2)),
which prioritizes high throughput as well as meeting the response-time Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) of different inference workloads,
mobile-side LLM inference places a greater emphasis on minimizing end-to-end latency.
The latency can be further divided into two parts: TTFT (Time to First Token) and TPOT (Time per Output Token).
The former is primarily influenced by the speed of prefill phase processing,
and the latter is associated with the token generation speed during the decoding phase.

### 2.2. Mobile-side Heterogeneous SoC

Considering the imperatives of personal privacy and security, there is a growing preference among
individuals to deploy LLMs on local mobile devices instead of transmitting personal data to cloud services.
Consequently, the mainstream vendors are actively enhancing their Edge-AI platform evolution,
including mobile platforms such as Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 (41), Apple’s A18 (4), MediaTek’s Dimensity 9300 (4), Huawei’s Kirin 9000 (19), etc.
Table [2](#S2.T2) lists the parameter specifications of several mainstream mobile SoC platforms.
To meet the substantial computational demands of LLMs, mobile platforms are evolving towards heterogeneous SoC architectures.
In addition to traditional CPUs and GPUs, NPUs, which are dedicated processors optimized for ML workloads,
are increasingly playing a critical role due to their superior computational power compared to CPUs and GPUs.
Moreover, these heterogeneous processors often utilize a unified physical memory, distinguishing them from discrete heterogeneous systems.

### 2.3. Limitations of Mobile-side Inference Engines

With the development of heterogeneous mobile SoCs,
numerous works have established frameworks for LLM inference to leverage the heterogeneous computational power at the edge,
such as llm.npu (56), PowerInfer2 (60), MNN-LLM (55), MLC (34), etc (11, 31, 21, 51, 13, 33).
In Table [1](#S2.T1), we provide a comprehensive comparison of existing approaches across multiple dimensions,
including support for different backends, impact on model accuracy and end-to-end performance of LLM inference.
Through this comparison, we identify two key aspects that existing works fail to address:

*Parallelizing computation between GPU and NPU.*
Although both GPUs and NPUs can accelerate the computation of LLM workloads and exhibit varying affinities for different operators,
existing research primarily focuses on leveraging a single accelerator within mobile SoC.
For instance, MLC (34) and MNN-LLM (55) exclusively utilize the GPU for computation,
whereas PowerInfer (60) and llm.npu (56) are limited to supporting the NPU backend.
This challenge stems from the difficulty involved in synchronization and coordination among heterogeneous processors.
Specifically, it is crucial to address how to efficiently synchronize data and effectively partition computational workloads across different backends.

*Fully utilizing NPU computational power without accuracy loss.*
Being the most powerful computing unit on modern SoCs,
NPUs have been utilized by frameworks such as llm.npu (56), Qualcomm-AI (42) to accelerate the inference process.
However, these approaches primarily leverage the INT capabilities of NPUs for low-precision computations
and do not fully exploit the available FLOAT capabilities.
Utilizing INT4/8 for computations can lead to significant degradation in model accuracy (20% reported by Qualcomm-AI), especially for small-sized edge models.
Although llm.npu seeks to address this issue by identifying tensor outliers and employing mixed-precision techniques,
this approach introduces sensitivity to the input dataset,
resulting in inference accuracy that is highly dependent on the user’s input.
Previous work (60) also tries to utilize the FLOAT capabilities of NPUs but often yields inefficient performance.
Due to the inherent hardware structure of NPUs, FLOAT performance can vary significantly based on tensor shape and ordering.

## 3. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS

To effectively utilize the heterogeneous processors,
we start by analyzing the performance of the GPU, NPU and memory system.
These accelerators exhibit diverse performance characteristics stemming from their unique hardware architectures.
In particular, NPUs display significant performance variability across different tensor types and operators.
Therefore, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the architectural differences among these heterogeneous accelerators,
and then summarize their performance characteristics.

Figure: Figure 1. The GPU performance with varying tensor sizes.

### 3.1. GPU Characteristics

*Characteristic GPU-1: Linear Performance.*
Figure [1](#S3.F1) illustrates the performance of mobile GPUs with varying tensor sizes.
When the tensor size is small, GPU computation is memory-bound.
With the increase of tensor size, the total FLOPS increases linearly.
Once the size surpasses a certain threshold, GPU computation turns to be computation-bound,
and the total FLOPS stays stable.

*Characteristic GPU-2: High-cost Synchronization.*
There are two primary types of synchronization overheads associated with mobile GPUs.
The first type arises from the data copy.
Since existing GPU frameworks still maintain a separate memory space for mobile GPUs,
developers must utilize APIs such as clEnqueueWriteBuffer to transfer data from the CPU-side buffer to GPU memory.
Secondly, the explicit synchronization command (clFinish) introduces a fixed latency of approximately 400 microseconds on our platform.
This overhead results from blocking the execution of subsequent GPU kernels and synchronizing the states of the GPU driver.
Upon completing the data transfer and executing the synchronization command,
it ensures that all states are consistent between the CPU and GPU views,
thereby enabling the consistent execution of subsequent CPU/GPU/NPU tasks.

### 3.2. NPU Characteristics

Although there are many different NPU implementations,
matrix computation units (e.g., systolic arrays) serve as the most critical component inside NPUs.
It leverages the data flow characteristics intrinsic to matrix computations,
thereby minimizing the redundant load/store operations of model weights and activation.
Figure [2](#S3.F2) demonstrates a classical systolic array design.
In the computing flow of systolic array, weights are preloaded into each processing element (PE) prior to the computation.
During the computation phase, a ‘weight stall’ mode is employed, where weights remain stationary while inputs or activations are fed into the systolic array.
Finally, the computation results are output from the systolic array and are either stored in on-chip SRAM or directly forwarded to the subsequent systolic array unit.
Due to this NPU computation paradigm, NPUs exhibit three distinct computational characteristics:
stage performance, order-sensitive performance and shape-sensitive performance.

Figure: Figure 2. The hardware design for NPU: Systolic array with the weight stall computing paradigm.

Figure: Figure 3. The stage performance of NPUs. The execution time of the Matmul operator across different tensor sizes.

*Characteristic NPU-1: Stage Performance. *
Due to the fixed size of the hardware systolic array within NPUs,
the dimensions of the tensor used by the Matmul operator may not align with the size of the matrix computation unit,
which can lead to inefficient use of NPU computational resources.
As shown in Figure [3](#S3.F3),
this misalignment results in a phenomenon referred to as *stage performance* across different tensor sizes.
For instance, in the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC, NPU is equipped with multiple $32\times 32$ systolic arrays.
Thus, any computing tensor with dimensions smaller than $32$ will exhibit the same computational latency,
leading to significant performance degradation for certain tensor shapes.
Furthermore, the compiler will partition tensors into tiles that align with the hardware size of the matrix computation unit.
When tensor dimensions are not divisible by this size,
the NPU compiler must introduce internal padding to align with the hardware requirement.
This alignment results in a stage performance effect during NPU calculations.

Figure: Figure 4. The order-sensitive and shape-sensitive performance of NPUs. The performance of the NPU is significantly influenced by the order and shape of the tensors.

*Characteristic NPU-2: Order-sensitive Performance.*
In addition to stage performance, NPUs also exhibit order-sensitive computation behavior.
Consider two tensors with dimensions $[M,N]$ and $[N,K]$, where $M>N>K$.
A conventional matrix multiplication (Matmul) operation requires $2\times M\times N\times K$ operations.
If we reverse the order of these tensors, i.e., $[K,N]\times[N,M]$, the total number of computation operations remains unchanged.
However, this can lead to significant performance degradation for the NPU, a phenomenon we refer to as *order-sensitive performance*.
Figure [4](#S3.F4) presents a specific example where the matrix multiplication operation of $[14336,4096]\times[4096,K]$ achieves 6$\times$ performance improvement compared to $[K,4096]\times[4096,14336]$.

The primary reason for order-sensitive performance is that NPU leverages the weight stall computing to minimize memory load/store overhead.
In the ideal situation, the weight tensor always fits perfectly within the hardware matrix computation unit, eliminating the need for additional memory operations.
However, when the weight tensor is significantly larger than the input tensor, it needs to load the weight tensor from the memory into the matrix computation unit more frequently,
increasing memory overhead during the NPU execution.
As a result, although $[K,N]\times[N,M]$ and $[M,N]\times[N,K]$ involve the same number of computational operations,
the larger size of $[N,M]$ results in inferior performance due to the extra memory operations involved.
In the worst-case scenario for NPU computation, if the weight matrix is infinite,
the matrix computation unit cannot take advantage of the weight-stall computing paradigm,
and thus, the NPU performance may regresses to or even worse than the GPU performance.

*Characteristic NPU-3: Shape-sensitive Performance.*
Similar to the order-sensitive performance, NPUs also exhibit *shape-sensitive performance* characteristic.
Even when the input tensor is larger than the weight tensor, the NPU’s efficiency is influenced by the ratio between row and column sizes.
More specifically, when the row size of the input tensor exceeds the column size,
NPU demonstrates a better performance (compare the blue line with the purple line in Figure [4](#S3.F4)).
Since the column size of the input tensor is shared with the weight tensor, a larger column size results in a larger weight tensor,
which undermines the advantages of the weight-stall computation paradigm as we mentioned above.

### 3.3. SoC Memory Bandwidth

*Characteristic Memory-1: Underutilized Memory Bandwidth with Single Processor.*
Although mobile SoCs adopt a unified memory address space across heterogeneous processors,
our measurements indicate that no single processor can saturate the SoC’s memory bandwidth during LLM decoding.
On the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 platform, the theoretical peak memory bandwidth is 68 GB/s,
while the maximum achievable bandwidth is approximately 61.9 GB/s,
obtained only under continuous large-bulk memory operations
(e.g., multi-threaded memcpy or NEON-load intrinsics on the CPU, and vector or image-buffer loads on the GPU).
However, under decoding workloads, each individual processor (CPU, GPU, or NPU) achieves only 40–45 GB/s, as shown in Figure [5](#S3.F5).
In contrast, concurrent GPU–NPU execution raises aggregate bandwidth utilization to around 60 GB/s,
with a 75/25 workload split that effectively overlaps GPU computation with NPU computation and synchronization overhead.
These results suggest that, as contemporary mobile SoCs are equipped with multiple memory channels,
co-execution of heterogeneous processors more fully utilizes the SoC’s memory bandwidth,
creating a new opportunity to accelerate memory-bound LLM decoding.

Figure: Figure 5. The total memory bandwidth with single and multiple processors. We execute the decoding workloads across different backends and measure the available memory bandwidth in the entire SoC.

## 4. DESIGN

Figure: Figure 6. The overall execution flow of a typical LLM with HeteroInfer: Operators within the orange blocks are executed on the GPU backend, whereas operators within the blue blocks can be offloaded to heterogeneous backends. HeteroInfer additionally supports tensor-level heterogeneous execution through different tensor partitioning strategies.

Given the distinct bottlenecks at different stages of LLM inference, our system adopts a stage-specific optimization strategy:
during the prefill stage, the objective is to maximize the computational throughput of the SoC,
whereas during the decoding stage, the focus shifts to maximize memory bandwidth utilization.
Figure [6](#S4.F6) illustrates the overall execution flow of a typical LLM using HeteroInfer.
Considering the power constraints of mobile systems and the need to accommodate other concurrently running applications,
we refrain from fully consuming all available computing units solely for LLM tasks.
For instance, CPUs, in particular, are not ideal as computational backends due to their relatively low energy efficiency and,
more critically, their significant involvement in general-purpose processing.
Therefore, HeteroInfer leverages the CPU only as a control plane to handle tasks such as synchronization and GPU kernel scheduling.

### 4.1. Layer-level GPU-NPU Execution

We begin with a coarse-grained strategy that assigns computation tasks to the GPU and NPU based on their computing affinities at the layer level.
For example, during the prefill phase, Matmul operators are allocated to the NPU,
which demonstrates superior performance in matrix multiplication computing operations.
In contrast, RMSNorm and SwiGLU operators are executed more efficiently on the GPU.
Besides, given that LLM models typically have larger weight tensors compared to user input tensors,
we adapt to the characteristics of *NPU-2: order-sensitive performance* by exchanging the computation order of the input and the weight tensor,
utilizing the following computational invariant: $[M,N]\times[N,K]\rightarrow[[K,N]\times[N,M]]^{T}$.
As for the decoding phase, due to *NPU-1: stage performance*, the GPU becomes the primary computational unit,
as it offers better performance in matrix–vector operations.

### 4.2. Tensor-level GPU-NPU Parallelism

While the layer-level approach leverages both the GPU and the NPU to accelerate LLM inference,
it falls short of fully utilizing the capabilities of a heterogeneous SoC due to three key limitations:

- •
NPU performance degradation for specific tensor shapes.
- •
Underutilization of SoC memory bandwidth and computational power of heterogeneous processors.
- •
Static NPU graphs with high graph generation costs.

To overcome these limitations, HeteroInfer introduces tensor-level parallel execution, enabled by three different partitioning strategies.

#### 4.2.1. Weight-centric partition with static shape

Problem.
When considering different tensor shapes, the NPU fails to outperform the GPU in all situations.
This unexpected performance result arises from two factors:
First, when the sequence length is short, the NPU cannot fully utilize all available computational resources due to *NPU-1: stage performance*,
resulting in performance that is similar to or even lower than the GPU’s.
Second, due to the dimensionality reduction matrix in the FFN-down layer,
the column size of this matrix is larger than the row size (after transposition).
This configuration is suboptimal for NPU execution,
yielding only a 0.5$\times$ to 1.5$\times$ performance over the GPU,
attributable to *NPU-3: shape-sensitive performance*.

To address these performance limitations, we propose a *weight-centric partitioning* strategy to enable parallel execution between the GPU and NPU.
To simplify the parallel strategy, we start by considering a fixed sequence length for user input,
enabling the NPU to construct the computation graph based on static tensor shapes.
As illustrated in Figure [7](#S4.F7),
this strategy partitions the weight tensor along its row dimension, assigning sub-tensors to the GPU and NPU for concurrent computation.
The partition ratio is statically determined by an offline solver (described in §[4.4](#S4.SS4)).

Figure: Figure 7. HeteroInfer partitions the weight tensor based on the row dimension, and dispatches computational loads to the different backends.

HeteroInfer explicitly incorporates synchronization points into the computation graph and manages the splitting and merging of intermediate results across different backends.
With an ideal partition ratio, the GPU and NPU complete their respective workloads simultaneously, thereby minimizing end-to-end inference latency.

Although the same partitioning strategy is applied, the rationale behind acceleration in the prefill and decoding phases differs.
During the prefill phase, the partitioning strategy leverages the GPU’s computational resources to accelerate computation—especially in scenarios where the NPU suffers from performance degradation due to unfavorable tensor shapes.
In contrast, during the decoding phase, the partitioning strategy is designed to address the underutilization of memory bandwidth when using a single computing unit (*Memory-1*).
This approach focuses on maximizing the memory bandwidth of the SoC while minimizing memory contention through GPU-NPU parallelism.

#### 4.2.2. Activation-centric partition with dynamic shape

Problem.
In real-world scenarios, user input typically has a dynamic sequence length,
while current mobile-side NPUs only support static graph execution.
This limitation arises from the dataflow graph compilation method (1, 50, 6),
which is widely adopted by contemporary mobile NPUs (43, 20).
To address this issue, a straightforward solution is to generate the computation graph at runtime.
However, this graph generation process incurs a non-trivial overhead that is proportional to the size of the tensors (68, 66, 46), as shown in Figure [8](#S4.F8).
In contrast, the GPU framework offers a set of kernel implementations,
each of which can be adapted to accommodate a variety of tensor shapes.
This capability facilitates dynamic-shape kernel execution at runtime.

Figure: Figure 8. The NPU graph generation time for a single operator across various tensor shapes.

In order to support dynamic activation shapes on the NPU,
a common approach is to select a set of predefined tensor shapes—such as powers of two—and pad the activation tensors to match these shapes.
For example, if the input sequence length is 300,
the inference engine pads it to 512 to avoid the overhead of generating a new NPU graph for the unmatched tensor shape.
However, this padding introduces computational redundancy.

To mitigate this issue, we propose an *activation-centric partitioning* strategy that
enables support for dynamic tensor shapes while minimizing the overhead caused by excessive padding.
As shown in Figure [9](#S4.F9),
HeteroInfer offloads computation tasks involving dynamic-shape tensors to the GPU (according to *GPU-1: linear performance*),
while retaining fixed-size tensor computations on the NPU.
For instance, consider an activation tensor with a sequence length of 300,
which can be partitioned into two segments: 44 and 256.
Since the segment of size 256 adheres to a standard shape,
its computation graph is pre-generated and can be executed directly on the NPU.
In contrast, the remaining segment of size 44 does not conform to a predefined shape for the NPU backend;
therefore, it can be processed by the GPU backend in parallel with the NPU.

To further balance the computational load between the NPU and GPU,
we adopt a multi-tensor activation partitioning strategy.
Considering that the GPU generally exhibits lower performance than the NPU,
we partition the activation tensor along the sequence length dimension into multiple sub-tensors,
each conforming to a standard shape, along with one additional sub-tensor that has an arbitrary shape.
All sub-tensors with standard shapes are executed sequentially on the NPU,
while the sub-tensor with a dynamic shape is offloaded to the GPU.
This approach allows us to minimize the computational load on the GPU and effectively balance the execution time between the GPU and NPU.

Figure: Figure 9. Due to the static computation graph of the NPU, HeteroInfer employs activation-centric partition to support the dynamic tensor shapes required by LLMs.

#### 4.2.3. Hybrid partition

Problem.
Although the activation-centric partitioning strategy facilitates support for dynamic tensor shapes,
it results in suboptimal utilization of the computational resources of both the GPU and NPU due to *NPU-3: shape-sensitive performance*.
Specifically, the sub-tensor offloaded to the GPU may be either too large or too small to fully exploit its computational capabilities,
or the tensor shape executed on the NPU may not be suitable for efficient NPU computation.

To address this issue, we propose a *hybrid partitioning* strategy that
combines activation-centric partition with padding to handle dynamic tensor shapes,
while leveraging weight-centric partition to offload tensors to both GPU and NPU,
as illustrated in Figure [9](#S4.F9).
Given that the weight tensor is typically larger than the activation tensors,
it allows for greater flexibility in partitioning the tensor into a more suitable shape for NPU computation.
Consequently, the hybrid partitioning strategy not only maximizes the computational power of heterogeneous processors
but also maintains system flexibility in accommodating dynamic user inputs.

### 4.3. Fast Synchronization

While GPU-NPU parallelism can reduce the execution time of certain operators,
it may also introduce additional overhead due to synchronization between the GPU and NPU (*GPU-2: high-cost synchronization*).
This issue arises because existing mechanisms, such as fences and clFinish, are not optimized for mobile SoCs.
The overhead becomes particularly pronounced during the decoding phase,
where the execution time of the Matmul operator is reduced to only a few hundred microseconds.

To mitigate this overhead, we employ two strategies.
First, mobile SoCs provide a unified address space,
which allows mapping a memory buffer into both host and device address spaces, eliminating the need for additional data transfers.
In the HeteroInfer runtime, a dedicated memory pool is reserved for allocating the input and output tensors of each operator.
Since different layers in LLMs share the same decoder block,
this memory pool requires only a few buffer slots, which can be reused across layers.
Furthermore, these buffer slots will not be reclaimed by the GPU / NPU driver,
ensuring that the mapping between CPU and GPU / NPU address spaces is maintained throughout model inference.

Second, we exploit the predictable waiting times for GPU kernels to facilitate fast synchronization.
Given that LLMs execute identical operations across each layer,
the waiting times for GPU kernels tend to be consistent and predictable across different layers.
We allow the synchronization thread to sleep for a predicted waiting time, followed by a polling mechanism to achieve precise synchronization.
Since the minimum granularity of ‘usleep’ in mobile SoCs is approximately 80 to 100 microseconds,
it cannot serve as an accurate synchronization mechanism.
Consequently, once the synchronization thread awakens,
it utilizes a small/middle CPU core to continuously monitor the output tensor of the last layer.
A flag bit is added alongside the output tensor and is updated once the output tensor is completely populated.
The CPU core only needs to poll this flag bit for a few microseconds and can immediately notify the NPU for subsequent execution as soon as the GPU kernel completes.

Figure: Figure 10. Fast synchronization during the prefill and decoding phases.

While both the prefill and decoding phases leverage GPU and NPU parallelism with fast synchronization,
several distinctions exist between these two phases, as shown in Figure [10](#S4.F10).
In the prefill phase, the NPU exhibits superior computational capability, making it NPU-dominant.
HeteroInfer effectively hides GPU execution time within NPU execution, but needs to delay the submission of the next GPU kernel until NPU execution is finished.
Although this introduces a task submission overhead during GPU-NPU synchronization,
this cost is approximately tens of microseconds and can thus be ignored in the prefill phase.

Conversely, in the decoding phase, the GPU outperforms the NPU because GPU kernel implementations obtain more stable and higher memory bandwidth, making this phase GPU-dominant.
Here, we overlap NPU execution with the GPU execution.
Upon NPU task completion, the subsequent GPU kernel is promptly enqueued.
The GPU’s inherent queue ordering ensures correct synchronization for GPU kernels
without incurring additional submission overhead.

### 4.4. Putting It All Together

Figure [11](#S4.F11) presents the overall architecture of HeteroInfer.
Given a target SoC, the performance profiler first measures its performance matrices by executing operations on the actual NPU or GPU.
The profiling results are then fed to the solver, which determines how to schedule and partition the workload across processors for running a given LLM on the specified SoC.
The solver’s output are subsequently used to generate the computation graph in advance. This entire process is performed offline.
During online inference, the inference engine dynamically selects an appropriate execution strategy based on the requested sequence length.

Figure: Figure 11. The overall architecture of HeteroInfer contains three components: Profiler, Solver and Inference Engine.

*Performance Profiler.*
The profiler executes the target operator with a variety of tensor shapes on both GPU and NPU to collect accurate performance metrics,
including execution time, memory bandwidth, and synchronization overhead.
The profiling space is constrained by three factors: (1) only weight tensor shapes from LLMs are considered;
(2) the NPU’s stage performance characteristic impose minimum size requirements on sub-tensors;
and (3) activation tensors are restricted to a predefined set of standard sequence lengths.
Benefiting from this reduced set of tensor shapes, the profiling process can be completed efficiently, typically in less than 20 minutes.

*Tensor Partitioning Solver.*
The solver determines the optimal tensor partitioning strategies for a given LLM based on profiling results.
It first analyzes the overall model structure to locate operators where workloads can be partitioned across heterogeneous processors,
such as those involved in attention projections and the FFN up/gate/down computations.
For each operator, the solver enumerates all feasible parallelization strategies and
selects the one that best overlaps computation with synchronization to minimize total latency, as formulated in the following equation.
Since the prefill sequence length may vary arbitrarily while the profiler only provides measurements for standard sequence lengths,
the solver estimates operator latency for variable-length sequences by leveraging the performance characteristics of *GPU-1: linear performance* and *NPU-1: stage performance*.

$$ $\displaystyle T_{\text{total}}$ $\displaystyle=\min\Big(\max(T_{\text{GPU}}^{\text{partition1}},T_{\text{NPU}}^{\text{partition2}})+T_{\text{sync}}+T_{\text{copy}},$ $\displaystyle T_{\text{GPU}}^{\text{all}},T_{\text{NPU}}^{\text{all}}+T_{\text{sync}}+T_{\text{copy}}\Big)$ $\displaystyle\text{s.t.}\quad\text{Partition1}+\text{Partition2}=\text{All}.$ $$

Table [3](#S4.T3) illustrates an example of the solver’s inputs and outputs.
For tensor shapes in the decoding phase, a weight-centric partitioning strategy is adopted,
with the GPU performing the majority of computation.
This is because GPU usually outperforms NPU in the matrix-vector multiplication operation.
While for tensor shapes in the prefill phase, the optimal partitioning strategy is more variable and shape-dependent.
For instance, with a weight tensor of shape [4096, 4096], where a significant performance gap exists between GPU and NPU,
an activation-centric partition is applied when the input sequence length falls within the range of 257-272.
In contrast, for a weight tensor of shape [4096, 14336],
the computational capabilities of the NPU and GPU are relatively comparable (approximately 3:2),
primarily due to *NPU-3: shape-sensitive performance*.
When the dynamic portion is relatively small—i.e., the prefill length only slightly exceeds a standard length—activation-centric partition may result in under-utilization of GPU resources.
In such cases, a hybrid partitioning strategy is preferred.

**Table 3. Input and output examples of the solver.**
| Weight<br>Tensor Shape | Activation<br>Tensor Shape | Latency (us) | Partitioning Strategy | Partition Ratio<br>(GPU : NPU) |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GPU | NPU |  |  |  |  |
| 4096, 4096 | 4096, 1 | 511 | 693 | Weight-centric | 1 : 1 |
| 28672, 4096 | 4096, 1 | 1903 | 3886 | Weight-centric | 3 : 1 |
| 4096, 14336 | 14336, 1 | 1467 | 6506 | No partition | GPU-only |
| 4096, 4096 | 4096, 128 | 7306 | 912 | No partition | NPU-only |
| 4096, 4096 | 4096, [193-255] | $9k\sim 11k$ | $1.2k\sim 1.9k$ | Padding | NPU-only |
| 4096, 4096 | 4096, 256 | 10841 | 1884 | No partition | NPU-only |
| 4096, 4096 | 4096, [257-272] | $\sim 11000$ | $\sim 1900$ | Activation-centric | Dynamic : 256 |
| 4096, 14336 | 14336, 256 | 35231 | 23445 | Weight-centric | 2 : 3 |
| 4096, 14336 | 14336, [257-384] | $35k\sim 50k$ | $23k\sim 32k$ | Hybrid | 2 : 3 (Weight) |

*Inference Engine.*
During execution, a control plane decider determines whether a kernel is executed on the NPU backend, the GPU backend,
or using GPU-NPU parallelism, based on the solver’s output and current states.
When two adjacent kernels are allocated to different backends, the inference engine employs a fast synchronization mechanism to ensure data consistency.
Upon completion of kernel execution on both backends, it merges intermediate results as needed.
Besides, the inference engine manages a memory pool for host-device shared buffers,
which are allocated or reclaimed as input and output tensors for each GPU/NPU kernel,
bypassing the organization of the device driver.

Figure: Figure 13. Prefill speed of MNN-OpenCL, llama.cpp, MLC, PowerInfer-2-FP16 and HeteroInfer across sequence lengths of 64, 256 and 1024 on multiple models.

### 5.1. Experimental Setup

We implemented an industrial-grade edge LLM engine: HeteroInfer, by developing optimized GPU kernels in OpenCL and incorporating NPU support via the QNN-NPU library.
The system supports both layer-level and tensor-level heterogeneous execution across the GPU and NPU.
As for the model quantization,
HeteroInfer employs the W4A16 (weight-only) quantization(^1^1 1 Only utilizes NPU’s TOPS during the decoding phase, as NPU currently does not support W4A16 for decoding.) (8, 30, 27, 7, 39)
which balances the model accuracy (FLOAT computation) and storage overhead (INT4 for weight storage).
We evaluate the performance of HeteroInfer on both Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and Snapdragon 8 Elite, two of the most powerful mobile SoCs.
For fair comparison with other works, all results in this paper are obtained on Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 unless otherwise noted.
Compared to previous approaches (60, 56, 42) that leverage low-precision computation and exploit model sparsity,
HeteroInfer maintains the model accuracy and demonstrates even better performance through more efficient NPU utilization and GPU-NPU parallelism.

In our evaluation, we compare HeteroInfer with representative mobile LLM inference engines that utilize GPU-only and NPU-only accelerators,
including llama.cpp (CPU), MLC (GPU), MNN (GPU), llm.npu (NPU), and powerinfer-2 (NPU).
We use batch size of 1 across all experiments, as concurrent requests are not yet common in current mobile-device deployment scenarios.
For end-to-end LLM workload tests conducted on the mobile platform,
HeteroInfer demonstrates a performance improvement ranging from 1.34$\times$ to 6.02$\times$ across various workloads when compared to other SOTA solutions.
More specifically, in the prefill stage, HeteroInfer achieves a performance enhancement of 3.29$\times$ to 24.9$\times$,
whereas in the decoding stage, it attains a performance improvement of 1.50$\times$ to 2.53$\times$.

### 5.2. End-to-End Performance on Mobile Platform

**Table 4. End-to-end benchmark configurations.**
| Task type | Dataset | Mean prefill tokens | Mean decoding tokens |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Multi-turn dialogue | BELLE multiturn chat | 54 | 374 |
| Simple QA | GSM8K | 296 | 340 |
| Long text processing | LongBench-TriviaQA | 1787 | 5 |

Figure [12](#S5.F12) compares the end-to-end latency of Hetero-tensor with other edge LLM engines across three representative tasks:
multi-turn dialogue (29), simple QA (37), and long-text processing (5) (detailed configurations in Table [4](#S5.T4)).
In the decoding-heavy multi-turn dialogue task with Llama-7B,
Hetero-tensor achieves a 2.06$\times$ and 3.40$\times$ speedup over MNN and llm.npu, respectively,
and even outperforms PowerInfer-2 (with sparse model) by 1.34$\times$.
This is enabled by optimized GPU kernels and efficient GPU-NPU parallelism that fully utilize SoC memory bandwidth.
On GSM8K, where prefill and decoding are balanced, Hetero-tensor yields a 2.62$\times$ average improvement.
In prefill-dominant workloads (Longbench), it delivers up to 6.02$\times$ speedup over MNN-OpenCL.
Notably, Hetero-tensor still matches or surpasses llm.npu performance under such workloads,
despite the latter utilizes mixed-precision computation which requires per-dataset quantization and may cause accuracy loss.

To better analyze the performance of HeteroInfer, we conduct detailed tests of both prefill and decoding stages.

Figure: Figure 14. Prefill latency of Online-prepare, Padding, Pipe and Hetero-tensor on Llama-8B with dynamic sequence lengths.

### 5.3. Prefill Performance

The evaluation of the prefill performance is conducted from two perspectives:
fixed sequence lengths that fit in pre-defined graphs
and dynamic sequence lengths that do not align with the NPU’s static graph.

#### 5.3.1. Fixed Sequence Length.

Figure [13](#S5.F13) compares the prefill performance across different frameworks with several fixed sequence lengths.
For Llama-8B with sequence length of 256,
Hetero-layer achieves 5.85$\times$, 5.64$\times$ and 24.9$\times$ speedup compared to MNN-OpenCL, MLC and llama.cpp.
Even compared to the NPU-only engine like PowerInfer-2-FP16, Hetero-layer achieves 3.29$\times$ speedup.
These performance improvements arise from optimization mechanisms,
including considerations of the affinity of NPU and GPU for different operators,
as well as equivalent tensor order exchanges for Matmul computations.

Based on this, Hetero-tensor takes a step further and outperforms Hetero-layer by 30.2% on average (up to 40.8% when sequence length is 32).
The prefill speed of Hetero-tensor reaches 247.9 tokens per second on Llama-8B
and is up to 1092 tokens per second on InternLM-1.8B.
This is because Hetero-tensor enables GPU-NPU parallelism by partitioning the weight and activation tensors (especially for FFN-down) into shapes that are suitable for NPU computation,
while offloading the remaining part for GPU computation.
This method further enhances the computational efficiency of both GPU and NPU.
On Snapdragon 8 Elite, Hetero-tensor achieves about 10.5% higher prefill performance than on Snapdragon 8 Gen 3,
benefiting from the enhanced capabilities of both the GPU and NPU.

Compared with other inference engines (56, 42) that only leverage NPU INT computation
and may sacrifice model accuracy (above 20% accuracy degradation for Qualcomm-AI),
HeteroInfer fully exploits the NPU’s computational power (FLOAT).
Furthermore, with the efficient GPU-NPU collaboration, HeteroInfer achieves comparable or even better performance compared to these works.
For instance, Hetero-tensor achieves 1092 tokens/s during the prefill phase with a sequence length of 256 on InternLM-1.8B,
while llm.npu (56) attains only 564 tokens/s under a similar model size.

Figure: Figure 15. Decoding rate of MNN-OpenCL, llama.cpp, MLC, PowerInfer-2 and Hetero-tensor on different models. The prompt sequence length is 256.

#### 5.3.2. Dynamic Sequence Length.

Since current mobile NPUs only support static computation graphs,
predefining a graph for every possible sequence length is infeasible.
A straightforward solution, termed Online-prepare, generates a new NPU computation graph at runtime for each sequence length.
However, this approach is inefficient, as online graph preparation may cause significant performance degradation.

Besides the straightforward solution, there are other alternative solutions such as Padding, NPU-pipe and Chunked-prefill.
Padding mechanism preloads graphs of standard sizes (e.g., 128, 256, 512)
and pads the misaligned inputs to the nearest size.
NPU-pipe mechanism partitions a dynamic-size computation graph into multiple standard-size computation graphs (FFN layer)
and executes these standard graphs sequentially on the NPU.
llm.npu adopts Chunked-prefill mechanism by splitting the input sequence into fixed-size chunks.
The chunk size must be chosen carefully to fully utilize the computational power of NPU and avoid unnecessary overhead.
For instance, Chunked-prefill can only achieve the maximum prefill performance until the sequence length is 1024,
and its performance is degraded to half when the sequence length is shortened to 256 (56).

Figure [14](#S5.F14) shows prefill latency of different methods under dynamic and misaligned sequence lengths.
Both graph preparation and computation times are reported for Online-prepare.
Hetero-tensor consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving 2.24$\times$, 2.21$\times$, and 1.35$\times$ speedups
over Online-prepare, Padding, and NPU-pipe, respectively, at a sequence length of 525.
Online-prepare generally exhibits the highest latency due to graph preparation overhead,
which grows with sequence length and the number of NPU graphs (typically 4).
For instance, at length 135, preparation takes 408.4 ms (34.6% of total latency), rising to 2050 ms at length 1000.
Padding causes stepwise increases in latency, leading to inefficiencies.
When sequence length slightly exceeds a standard size,
the padding mechanism will introduce average 1.91$\times$ overhead compared with Hetero-tensor.
NPU-pipe mitigates padding overhead by partitioning the whole computation graph into smaller subgraphs with standard sizes.
Compared to the NPU-pipe approach, Hetero-tensor further reduces the prefill latency by 13.2% to 30.1%
by adaptively choosing the optimal partitioning strategy and enabling simultaneous execution of different computation subgraphs.

### 5.4. Decoding Performance

Figure [15](#S5.F15) presents the decoding speed of Hetero-tensor and other inference engines.
Hetero-tensor reaches up to 14.01 tokens/s on Llama-8B, 29.9 tokens/s on Llama-3B
and 51.12 token/s on InternLM-1.8B.
On Llama-8B, Hetero-tensor achieves 1.50$\times$, 2.53$\times$ and 1.52$\times$ speedup
compared to MNN-OpenCL, llama.cpp, MLC, respectively.
Even compared to PowerInfer-2 which utilizes the sparse model, Hetero-tensor still achieves 1.32$\times$ speedup,
because sparse computations resulting in numerous random and small memory accesses, compromising the overall memory bandwidth.

Hetero-tensor is the only framework that utilizes both GPU and NPU in the decoding phase, and maximizes the SoC memory bandwidth.
When NPU and GPU are running concurrently, the memory bandwidth
increases from 43.3 GB/s (only GPU) to 59.5 GB/s, achieving 96% of the maximum available memory bandwidth.
Given that the primary bottleneck during the decoding phase is memory bandwidth,
we assert that Hetero-tensor is approaching the theoretical maximum decoding performance.
Compared with Hetero-layer, Hetero-tensor further leverages weight-centric partitioning strategy for the Matmul operator,
and achieves a 22.0% speedup in decoding stage for Llama-8B model.
We also evaluate Hetero-tensor ’s decoding performance on Snapdragon 8 Elite.
Since the memory bandwidth of our selected Snapdragon 8 Elite device is the same as that of Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 device,
the decoding performance remains similar.

Figure: Figure 16. Prefill speed of Hetero-layer and Hetero-tensor with and without fast synchronization under sequence lengths of 64, 256 and 1024.

Figure: Figure 17. Decoding rate of Hetero-tensor running Llama-8B, Llama-7B, Llama-3B and InternLM-1.8B with and without fast synchronization. The prompt sequence length is 256.

### 5.5. Effect of Fast Synchronization

*Prefill Performance.*
Figure [16](#S5.F16) presents the prefill performance of Hetero-layer and Hetero-tensor with and without fast synchronization.
On Llama-8B, fast synchronization yields average speedups of 15.8% for Hetero-layer and 24.3% for Hetero-tensor.
Under a sequence length of 256, the prefill speed of Hetero-tensor increases from 196.44 tokens/s to 236.92 tokens/s.
Due to GPU-NPU parallelism, Hetero-tensor is more sensitive to synchronization overhead,
which can disrupt computational balance between the GPU and NPU.

*Decoding Performance.*
Figure [17](#S5.F17) presents the decoding performance of Hetero-tensor with and without fast synchronization.
On Llama-8B, the decoding rate of Hetero-tensor speedups to 4.01$\times$ with fast synchronization.
On other models, we observe comparable improvements of 2.2$\times$ speedup.
The speedup in decoding phase is much higher than that in prefill phase,
because the execution time of each kernel in the decoding phase is much shorter.
Thus, the overhead of synchronization and GPU kernel submission is non-negligible.

### 5.6. Ablation Study

Since optimizations (NPU optimization, GPU-NPU parallelism, and fast synchronization) are only effective when applied jointly in the decoding stage,
our ablation analysis focuses on the prefill stage.
As illustrated in Figure [18](#S5.F18),
all of the techniques tailored to NPU and GPU characteristics effectively enhance prefill performance.
When running the Llama-8B model, naïve NPU implementation is even 62.5% slower than GPU baseline due to the overhead of generating computation graphs on-the-fly.
Applying activation-centric partition eliminates this overhead, resulting in a 2.05$\times$ speedup.
Building on this, HeteroInfer further achieves a 1.79$\times$ improvement by rearranging the tensor ordering during computation to address the order-sensitive nature of NPU.
When considering the shape-sensitive performance characteristics of NPUs,
enabling weight-centric partition results in an additional 1.20$\times$ speedup.
Finally, an efficient synchronization mechanism reduces GPU and NPU idle time during synchronization,
leading to a further 1.19$\times$ speedup.

Figure: Figure 18. Ablation study of HeteroInfer when the prompt sequence length is 320. *NPU** stands for combination of all previous NPU techniques.

### 5.7. GPU Performance Interference

To evaluate the impact of HeteroInfer on system-level image rendering as well as interference with other GPU applications,
we conduct experiments by running GPU-only, Hetero-layer and Hetero-tensor concurrently with a high-performance mobile game (League of Legends: Wild Rift),
all graphical settings in the game are kept at default values.

Figure: Figure 19. Prefill and decoding speed of GPU-only, Hetero-layer, and Hetero-tensor with and without concurrent game execution, along with the game’s frame rate (FPS). Model: Llama-8B; prompt sequence length: 256.

As shown in Figure [19](#S5.F19), when running concurrently with the game,
the prefill speeds of Hetero-layer and Hetero-tensor decrease by only 0.5% and 2.2%, respectively,
while the game’s frame rate (FPS) remains unaffected.
In contrast, running concurrently with the GPU-only baseline results in a severe FPS drop to zero—because the GPU kernels launched by the OpenCL runtime saturate the GPU submission queue,
preventing the game’s rendering tasks from completing within their required time budget.
In comparison, Hetero-layer and Hetero-tensor offload only a small portion of computation to the GPU,
preserving sufficient GPU resources for timely game rendering.

In the decoding phase, the FPS drop of the GPU-only baseline is alleviated, with the game maintaining 46 FPS,
primarily because the GPU workload is lighter than in the prefill phase.
Hetero-tensor continues to have no impact on FPS but suffers a 17.7% reduction in decoding speed due to delayed GPU kernel execution,
which prevents full overlap between NPU and GPU execution.

### 5.8. Energy Consumption

Figure [20](#S5.F20) presents the power and energy consumption of GPU-only, Hetero-layer, and Hetero-tensor.
During the prefill phase, Hetero-layer exhibits the lowest power consumption of 2.23$\mathrm{W}$,
primarily due to its reliance on the NPU for most computations.
In the decoding phase, Hetero-tensor achieves the lowest power consumption by offloading computation to both the NPU and GPU.
In terms of end-to-end energy consumption, Hetero-tensor is the most efficient,
consuming 55% less energy than GPU-only and 12.8% less than Hetero-layer, owing to its faster execution.

Figure: Figure 20. Power consumption during prefill and decoding, and end-to-end energy consumption for GPU-only, Hetero-layer, and Hetero-tensor (prompt sequence length: 256; output length: 32).

## 6. DISCUSSION

*Platform and Model Generality.*
Modern mobile SoCs commonly adopt similar hardware characteristics, such as unified memory architecture,
an asynchronous GPU execution model, and a systolic-array-based NPU.
Since the core observations and techniques of HeteroInfer are designed around these widely adopted features,
the system can be ported to other mobile SoCs with minimal retuning.
In terms of different models, even when the model architecture changes (e.g., MoE),
the underlying operator types invoked during computation remain largely consistent.
Our design focuses on operator-level optimization and enables GPU-NPU parallelism at the kernel granularity.
As a result, the system is also applicable to models with diverse architectures and parameter configurations.

*Model Quantization.*
HeteroInfer employs W4A16 (weight-only) quantization, striking a balance between memory footprint and computational accuracy.
W4A16 quantization is the most widely used approach in real-world deployments.
W4A16 quantizes model weights during storage and dequantizes them to FLOAT for computation.
In contrast, other approaches (56, 60, 42) require quantization of both activations and weights
to INT, which impairs inference accuracy.

*Parallelism among Accelerators.*
While the parallelization of ML workloads is a well-established field,
existing research(9, 63) has predominantly focused on distributing computations across homogeneous, discrete accelerators like NVIDIA GPUs and Google TPUs.
Some prior approaches(49, 22), such as AccPar, have addressed heterogeneous systems.
However, their scope is often confined to cloud-based scenarios,
and the accelerators considered are typically from the same vendor lineage (e.g., TPUv2 and TPUv3),
which feature similar hardware architectures and a unified software stack.
In contrast, our work addresses the challenge of parallelization across fundamentally distinct accelerators integrated within a single mobile SoC.

*Design of Future Edge AI Accelerators and Systems.*
Based on our experience in optimizing LLMs on commercial SoCs,
we suggest that current edge AI SoCs can be further improved along following dimensions.
First, unified GPU–NPU scheduling is needed. As future edge scenarios will involve increasingly complex multi-task workloads,
including GPU-only, NPU-only, and GPU–NPU parallel tasks(47),
the absence of a unified scheduling mechanism may lead to situations where tasks running on one processor simultaneously block the execution of tasks on both processors.
Second, although current mobile SoCs adopt UMA, they often lack coherent memory management across different processing units.
In our implementation, we establish shared memory between the CPU and GPU using OpenCL,
between the CPU and NPU via QNN APIs, and further enable GPU-NPU shared memory.
A unified API and memory management layer across CPU, GPU, and NPU would greatly simplify development and reduce unnecessary synchronization overhead.
Third, a fast and lightweight synchronization library for heterogeneous processors would facilitate efficient overlap of computation and communication.

## 7. CONCLUSION

This paper introduces HeteroInfer, the fastest LLM inference engine optimized for heterogeneous processors in modern mobile SoCs.
We conduct an in-depth analysis of the GPU and NPU hardware architectures, highlighting the NPU’s tensor shape-sensitive performance characteristics.
HeteroInfer leverages the GPU to improve the lower bound of NPU performance and enhance computational flexibility.
It introduces several key techniques, including tensor partition, fast synchronization, and profiler-solver collaboration,
to address the challenges of underutilized memory bandwidth and computing resources.
HeteroInfer demonstrates a 1.34$\times$ to 6.02$\times$ speedup in real-world benchmarks,
while maintaining negligible interference with other applications.
Finally, this work offers new insights into the design of more efficient edge AI accelerators and heterogeneous SoCs.
